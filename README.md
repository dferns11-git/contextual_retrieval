# Contextual Retrieval Project

## Overview

This project implements **Contextual Retrieval**, an advanced technique developed by Anthropic to enhance the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By ensuring that data chunks are enriched with relevant context, this approach significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.

## Features

- **Contextual Embeddings**: Each data chunk is augmented with specific contextual information, preserving essential details that might otherwise be lost. This allows the AI to generate responses that are not only accurate but also meaningful.
- **Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm**: Utilizes a modified version of the BM25 algorithm that incorporates enriched context during indexing and searching, improving the system's ability to retrieve the most relevant information based on user queries.
- **Performance Improvements**: Demonstrates significant reductions in retrieval failures—up to 49% when using contextual embeddings combined with enhanced BM25.
- **Efficient Processing**: Implements prompt caching to reduce costs associated with generating contextualized chunks, making it feasible to process large datasets economically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contextual-retrieval.git
   cd contextual-retrieval
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run the contextual retrieval model, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_data> --output <path_to_output>
```

Replace `<path_to_data>` with your input data file and `<path_to_output>` with your desired output file path.
